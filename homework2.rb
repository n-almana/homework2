# What is an "instance variable"? See if you can find and explanation using google. 
	# Instance variables begin with an at sign (@) and can be referenced only within class methods. 
	# Its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to. 
	# Two different objects, even if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

# Use online ruby documentation (ruby-doc.org) to describe a method of the Integer class. 
	# The integer class holds whole numbers. The "downto(limit)" method is an example method of the integer class: 
		# downto(limit) {|i| block } â†’ self
		# Iterates the given block, passing decreasing values from int down to and including limit.

		# 5.downto(1) { |n| print n, ".. " }
		# print "  Liftoff!\n"
		# #=> "5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1..   Liftoff!"
